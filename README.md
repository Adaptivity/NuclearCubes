##FAQ:

* __Oh no! I found a bug/leak with it! D:__
   
   Please feel free to make a PR with a fix or open an issue on GitHub.

* __Can you include X feature?__
   
   Maybe. If I say no to something, and you _really_ want it... Code it, submit a PR, and we'll see from there.

* __Can you port to Minecraft 1.X.X?__ 
   
   No. Strictly 1.7.10 (If I release before 1.8) and later.

* __Why did you make this?__

   I love BigReactors, but I wanted a different balancing scheme. So instead of writing my own competing mod (like I originally planned), I decided to create an overhaul addon, instead.
